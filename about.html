      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <p>
        <text><b>How are items being sold verified?</text></b></p>
      <p>
      <text> Each item being added to our marketplace is reviewed by us before being posted. We also have a 2-week policy which ensures that if you don’t receive your item(s) within this time period, you will receive a full refund. 
      </text>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <text><b>I am having issues with uploading items/buying an item/I haven’t received my item?
      </b></text>
      </p>
      <p>
      <text>Please see our contact page and get in touch. A member of our team will be able to help resolve this issue. 
      </text>
      </p>
      
       <p>
      <text><b>Do you accept returns or exchanges?
      </b></text>
      </p>
      <p>
      <text>We are able to accept returns, it will be returned to the original seller- not us. We do not do exchanges due to the nature of the site, it is a marketplace so each seller is likely only selling one of each item. Please see our returns and refunds policy for terms and conditions. If you are unhappy with an item you have received, please contact us to discuss a refund. For further queries, please see our returns and refunds policy. 
      </text>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <text><b>What payment methods do you accept?
      </b></text>
      </p>
      <p>
      <text>We currently only accept card payments on our site. If you choose to purchase an item from a seller outside of our site, we are not liable for any issues that may arise e.g. not receiving item/item being damaged or faulty or not receiving item. 
      </text>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <text><b>What delivery options do you have? Would I be able to pick an order up?
      </b></text>
      </p>
      <p>
      <text>Due to our site being made of individual student sellers, the seller will be sending the item for delivery to the address you provide. You could make alternative arrangements with the seller if the item is large and cannot be delivered thus there will be no charge for delivery. 
      </text>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <text><b>Can I track my order?
      </b></text>
      </p>
      <p>
      <text>If you would like the option of a tracked delivery, most sellers will offer this however it will result in a higher delivery charge. The standard delivery will not be tracked unless you have requested to do so.
      </text>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <text><b>Can I use Klarna or do several payments instead of one upfront payment?
      </b></text>
      </p>
      <p>
      <text>Unfortunately this is not possible on our site, all payments will be an individual upfront payment. 
      </text>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <text><b>Where do you ship?
      </b></text>
      </p>
      <p>
      <text>All items are limited to shipping within the UK.
      </text>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <text><b>Do I need to message the seller before buying?
      </b></text>
      </p>
      <p>
      <text>We recommend contacting the seller beforehand to sort any queries/confirm the item is still available and ready to ship.
      </text>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <text><b>What are the delivery costs?
      </b></text>
      </p>
      <p>
      <text>It depends on the seller & the item of which they are selling. Naturally the heavier the item, the more expensive shipping will be. It also depends on if you opt for standard delivery or first class etc.
